construct a gasussian with some parameters
sample w1..wk points from gaussian with some pararmter
construct feature map
map data to fature map
do linear regression to that map


QUESTIONS:
1) How can I optimize my code for question 2? There is no way I will find a suitable lambda and sigma at the rate is runs!
2) I still don't think I understand the notion of a "feature map" is this like the matrix of gaussian values we get for question 2?
3) I don't see how to use the fourier feature at all. Does it replace the kernel from problem 2?
4) For the spline question, I found an article stating that SVM's were a special case of smooth splines? Is saying this enough? I don't understand their work
5) Is a piecewise function good as a counterexample for 4?

Use best sigma from 2 in problem 3

spline is basically a polynomial kernel?
check wikipedia

X is k * n matrix
W is D * k matrix
Z is D by n
